You: I am registering Application host, any prechecks I need to do          
Bot: Yes, there are several requirements and supported configurations to keep in mind when registering an Application Host for Microsoft SQL Server data protection:

**Requirements:**

*   The Application Host can be a physical host or configured on a VMware vCenter.
*   If the Application Host is a VM, install VMware Tools. Windows 2016 or later requires version 10.1.0 or higher.
*   Enable the UUID attribute on the VM settings (if applicable).
*   Enable the Windows Remote Management (WinRM) service on the Application Host.
*   Configure firewall rules for WinRM service ports for data protection.
*   Ensure your security policies allow WinRM communication using NTLM authentication.
*   DNS should properly resolve the FQDN of the host being registered.
*   Use SCSI disks only, and have enough free SCSI slots for all disks.
*   Support only Virtual Raw Device Mapping (VRDM) with disk mode set to dependent.
*   Restrict virtual disk presentation on individual SCSI controllers per VMware's support guide.
*   Have at least 10% free disk space on all disks.
*   Configure the Quorum witness on Windows Server Failover Cluster (WSFC) to use File Share Witness.

**Things to Avoid (Unsupported Configurations):**

*   Array replication-based snapshots and backups.
*   Application Hosts with IDE disks, Storage Spaces managed virtual disks, dynamic disks, Physical Raw Device Mapping disks, or GPT disks without MSR partitions.
*   VMware Changed Block Tracking (CBT) is not supported for database backups on Application Hosts configured with RDM disks in Physical compatibility mode or with disks directly attached via SAN.
*   Virtual disks attached through a shared virtual SCSI bus on the Application Host.

**Caveats:**

*   A maximum of 35 databases can be added to a Protection Group for a virtual MSSQL Application Host.
*   Restore of a virtual MSSQL will fail if user-created snapshots exist on the VM. Delete the snapshots and retry.
*   Ensure ports 5985, 5986, 9387, and 9388 are open for communication.
*   Snapshot and array-optimized backups are not supported for virtual machines configured with disks presented from non-HPE storage systems. (CBT is still an option.)
*   Separate Protection Groups are recommended for Data Services Cloud Console-supported storage and VMs from unsupported storage if you plan to use snapshot protection or array-optimized backups.
*   Microsoft SQL Server Protection Groups can only include databases from Application Hosts managed by the same VMware vCenter server.
*   Manually refresh any changes to SQL Server Database or Instance configurations. (Automatic periodic refresh also occurs.)

You: How to enavble winrm service, which are the ports                  
Bot: To enable the WinRM service, you can use the following PowerShell command:

```powershell
winrm quickconfig
```

This command performs the following actions:

*   Starts the WinRM service.
*   Sets the startup type to automatic.
*   Creates a listener to accept requests on any IP address.
*   Enables firewall exceptions for WinRM traffic.

The default ports used by WinRM are:

*   **5985** for HTTP
*   **5986** for HTTPS

For Backup and Recovery's Microsoft SQL Server protection, ensure that ports **5985** and **5986** are open in your firewall for communication between the Application Host and the Data Orchestrator. Additionally, ports **9387** and **9388** are also used and should not be blocked. These ports are used for transferring transaction logs from the Application Host to the Protection Store Gateway.


You: how can I verify winrm is applicable
Bot: To verify if WinRM is configured correctly, you can use the following PowerShell command:

```powershell
winrm get winrm/config
```

This will display the current WinRM configuration settings. Look for the following:

*   **WinRMService.Service.Running:** Should be True, indicating the service is running.
*   **WinRMService.Service.StartupType:** Should be Automatic, ensuring the service starts automatically on system boot.
*   **Client.TrustedHosts:** This should either list the specific IP addresses or hostnames of trusted clients, or have a wildcard (\*) indicating all hosts are trusted.  If this is blank, no remote connections are allowed. For security reasons, use specific addresses where possible.
*   **Listener:** Check for listeners on the required ports (5985 for HTTP and 5986 for HTTPS). Ensure the Transport is HTTP or HTTPS and the `Enabled` flag is True.

If WinRM isn't configured properly or the service isn't running, use the `winrm quickconfig` command as discussed earlier to automatically configure it.  Remember to configure `TrustedHosts` appropriately.

You can also test connectivity from another machine (like your Data Orchestrator) using the following command:

```powershell
Test-WsMan <Application_Host_FQDN_or_IP>
```

This command attempts a connection to the specified Application Host and reports whether or not WinRM is accessible.  If this test fails, revisit the firewall and WinRM configuration on the Application Host.


You: ok, awesome thanks
Bot: You're welcome! If you have any other questions, feel free to ask.

You: exit
Goodbye!
